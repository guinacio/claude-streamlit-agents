## Strategy

* Always call a specialized agent if they can help in a task.

## Agent Usage Guidelines

Call specialized agents during planning and implementation when:

### Streamlit UX Architect Agent

* UI/UX design decisions and layout optimization
* Component selection and user flow design
* Dashboard structure and interface architecture
* User experience improvements and workflow design
* Multi-step process design and navigation

### Streamlit Docs Analyzer Agent

* Understanding Streamlit features and capabilities
* Performance optimization and best practices
* Memory management and large dataset handling
* Component functionality and API usage
* Troubleshooting Streamlit-specific issues

### General Purpose Agent

* Complex multi-step research tasks
* Code searching across large codebases
* File system exploration and pattern matching
* Cross-technology integration research

**CRITICAL**: Always consult the appropriate specialized agent during the planning phase for any task that falls within their expertise area, not just during implementation.

### WebSearch

When performing web searches, limit the number of queries to what is strictly necessary. Stop searching once sufficient context has been gathered to complete the task effectively.
